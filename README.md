# Data & Visualization instructional materials at NC State University Libraries

## About

This repository contains materials developed at NC State University Libraries for use in instructional support. These materials are intended as a resource for anyone who wants to learn about a specific data and visualization topic or conduct data and visualization instruction. An effort has been made to produce materials that are useful outside of an in-person instruction session.

## Repository organization

Each folder in this repository contains guided activities, computational notebooks (e.g., Jupyter Notebook), and/or datasets used in an NC State University Libraries led instruction session.

### Data Analysis with Python

These materials provide an introduction to cleaning and exploring a dataset with Python using the data analysis library pandas and the visualization library Matplotlib. This activity was originally developed for inclusion in the [Library Research Skills for Engineers and Scientists Learning Modules](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/undergraduateresearchmodules/home), a series of learning modules designed to present information skills necessary to be a successful researcher in sciences & engineering.

### MI REU 2021

This collection of Jupyter notebooks provides an introduction to Jupyter Notebook, programming with Python, and data science techniques with the Python libraries pandas and matplotlib. These materials were originally developed for inclusion in a collection of asynchronous learning modules created as part of a Materials Informatics Research Engagement for Undergraduates project.
