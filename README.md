# Data & Visualization instructional materials at NC State University Libraries

## About

This repository contains materials developed at NC State University Libraries for use in instructional support. These materials are intended as a resource for anyone who wants to learn about a specific data and visualization topic or conduct data and visualization instruction. An effort has been made to produce materials that are useful outside of an in-person instruction session.

## Repository organization

Each folder in this repository contains guided activities, computational notebooks (e.g., Jupyter Notebook), and/or datasets used in an NC State University Libraries led instruction session.
